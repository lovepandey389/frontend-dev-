            Welcome to my portfolio! I am Love Pandey, a B.Tech 3rd year student at GLA University, Mathura. 
            This page showcases my journey in web development and highlights my skills, projects, and passion 
            for creating innovative digital solutions. Feel free to explore and learn more about my work.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated computer science student with a strong interest in frontend and full-stack 
                development. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects involving HTML, 
                CSS, JavaScript, and modern web frameworks. I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, 
                and building applications that provide great user experiences. My goal is to become a skilled 
                developer who can contribute to meaningful projects and make a positive impact through technology.

            <h2>My First Blog: Beginning My Web Development Journey</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Date:</strong> November 2025
            </p>
            <p>
                Today marks an important milestone in my web development journey as I create my first structured 
                HTML webpage. Learning semantic HTML has helped me understand how to build <em>accessible</em> and 
                <em>well-organized</em> websites. I'm excited to continue exploring more advanced concepts like 
                responsive design, JavaScript interactivity, and modern frameworks.<br><br>
                
                The world of web development is <mark>vast and fascinating</mark>, and I can't wait to see where 
                this journey takes me! Every day I discover something new, whether it's a clever CSS trick, a 
                powerful JavaScript function, or a design pattern that makes code more maintainable.<br><br>
                
                As <cite>Steve Jobs</cite> once said in a memorable quote:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. 
                Don't settle.
