            Welcome to my portfolio! I am Love Pandey, a B.Tech 3rd year student at GLA University, Mathura. 
            This page showcases my journey in web development and highlights my skills, projects, and passion 
            for creating innovative digital solutions.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated computer science student with a strong interest in frontend and full-stack 
                development. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects involving HTML, 
                CSS, JavaScript, and modern web frameworks. I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, 
                and building applications that provide great user experiences.

            <h2>My First Blog</h2>
            <p>
                Today marks an important milestone in my web development journey as I create my first structured 
                HTML webpage. Learning semantic HTML has helped me understand how to build accessible and 
                well-organized websites. I'm excited to continue exploring more advanced concepts like responsive 
                design, JavaScript interactivity, and modern frameworks. The world of web development is vast and 
                fascinating, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me!
