    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <p>
        My favorite hobby is <strong>coding</strong>. I find it incredibly <em>satisfying</em> 
        to solve complex problems and build applications that can make a difference in people's lives. 
        Whether it's developing websites, creating algorithms, or learning new programming languages, 
        coding keeps me engaged and constantly challenged.
