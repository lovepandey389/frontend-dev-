    <h1>My Development Journey</h1>
    <p>
        As a <strong>passionate developer</strong>, I believe that <em>learning never stops</em> in 
        the tech world.<br>
        Every <mark>new project</mark> teaches me something valuable, and I'm constantly amazed by 
        how much there is to explore.<br>
        From HTML and CSS to JavaScript frameworks, the journey has been <strong>incredible</strong> 
        and <em>rewarding</em>.
